RothParty monitors a devices's configuration, including software and hardware and uses SVN Subversion to maintain history of changes.

RothParty does this by the very simple process summarized here:

    login to each device in the configuration file,
    run various commands to get the information that will be saved,
    cook the output; re-format, remove oscillating or incrementing data,
    and finally commit those changes to the revision control system 


This supports:

IronPorts MailGateway
PaloAlto Firewalls
